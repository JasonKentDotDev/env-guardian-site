# Set priority level for `scan` results

## `set-priority`

Running the `scan` command will display a report of all used instances of current Environment Variables 
as well as suggestions for variables you may want to add to your .env file. Each suggestion is assigned a severity level. 
You may set the priority level so that when you `scan`, the results only display from the selected priority level and above.

```bash
# Run set-priority command
env-guardian set-priority high

# Results
âœ” Priority set to [HIGH]
```

## reset-priority

You may revert the `scan` results to default and display all usages and suggenstions.

```bash
# Run reset-priority command
env-guardian reset-priority

# Results
ðŸ”„ Priority filter reset. All severities will be shown on scan.
```
