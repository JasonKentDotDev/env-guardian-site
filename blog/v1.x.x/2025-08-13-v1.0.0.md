The initial launch of env-guardian! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ <!-- truncate -->

Env-Guardian is a CLI tool that you can use to scan your project, or even just specific folders, for possible variables that you have in your code that should probably actually be considered secrets.

Instructions on how to get started can be found [here](../../docs/intro).
